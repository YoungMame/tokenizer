ERC20 guidelines require that the Smart Contract implements six mandatory functions and three optional ones.

The 3 optional functions:

To give a name: MameCoin

To give a symbol: MCN

To define the number of decimals: 8

The 6 mandatory functions:

totalSupply: Manages the maximum number of tokens. The Smart Contract must be able to stop creating tokens once the limit is reached.

balanceOf: Manages balances. The Smart Contract must be able to tell how many tokens an address owns.

transfer: The Smart Contract uses this method to send tokens from the provider to a user.

transferFrom: The Smart Contract handles transferring tokens between users.

approve: The Smart Contract determines if it can give tokens to a user by checking that the total tokens in circulation havenâ€™t reached the limit.

allowance: The Smart Contract verifies that the user trying to send tokens has a minimum amount to complete the transfer.

From a programming perspective, the developer creating the Smart Contract just needs to implement the ERC20 interface.
